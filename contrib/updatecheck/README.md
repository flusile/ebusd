ebusd.eu update webservice
==========================

This is the code of the webservice at https://upd.ebusd.eu/ that allows ebusd to check its own version and the
configuration files for availability of new versions.

It is enabled by default in ebusd due to the default value of the `--updatecheck=on` commandline option.
